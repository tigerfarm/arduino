# Altair 101 Hardware Notes

This is an Altair 8800 emulator with an emulator program that runs on an Arduino Mega microcontroller.
Component additions to the original Altair 8800:
+ Micro SD card module for reading and writing program and data files.
+ An MP3 player controlled by using the front panel toggles with the lights displaying status.
+ A clock module to display the current time and date on the front panel lights.

For reference, link to the [Altair 8800c](https://deramp.com/altair_8800c.html).
Excellent modernization of the original Altair 8800.
The Altair 8800c is hardware build that works the same as the Altair 8800.
I'm using programming emulation with enhancements
such as EXAMINE PREVIOUS, to examine the data byte in the previous address.

#### Arduino Due and Mega

USB and Power:
````
A DC connector for voltage supply between 7V and 12V.
The USB Programming port, next to the DC connector, is for uploading sketches and communicating with the Arduino.
The Native USB port can be used as a virtual serial port using the "SerialUSB" object in the Arduino programming language.
The Native USB port has other uses as well.
````

Mega with tech specs: https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mega-2560-rev3

Add Arduino Due board option to the IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Cores
````
Click on Tools menu and then Tools/Board/Boards Manager.
Install Arduino SAM Boards (32-bits ARM Cortex-M3) by Arduino, boards: Arduino Due.
I installed version 1.6.12.
Once installed, select: Tools/Board:Arduino ARM (32-bit) boards/Arduino Due/Arduino Due(Programming Port)
````

Configure the IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoDue
````
I powered the Arduino Due on and off a few times before the new port showed up.
Loaded the auduinoTest.ino program into the IDE and clicked Upload.
The program loaded and ran fine.
  Sketch uses 11164 bytes (2%) of program storage space. Maximum is 524288 bytes.
  ...
Onboard LED light blinks on and off.
The Loop counter messages shows in the IDE monitor window.
````

Issue compiling Processor.ino for Due:
````
Need to change A12 and A14, as those are not Due pins. Due has A0 to A11.
Need to remove LCD references, to compile.
    WARNING: library LiquidCrystal_I2C claims to run on avr architecture.
Should use "#define SETUP_LCD 1", to remove all LCD actions.

## Build History

Your mobile phone has a touch screen display. Your computer has a keyboard(input) and monitor(output).
In 1975, the Altair 8800, the first available popular computer only had toggles(input) and lights(output).
It launched the home computer revolution.
I wanted one, I want one, so I designed the Altair 101 to have the same front panel of toggles and LED lights.

My hardware design centers around my [Altair 8800 clone front panel](https://www.adwaterandstir.com/product/front-panel/).

[<img width="360px"  src="../FrontPanel01a.jpg"/>](https://www.adwaterandstir.com/product/front-panel/)

I completed my goal was to design and build a machine to emulate the base Altair 8800 machine.
The emulator also has modern components such as a micro SD card module for storage and a 32 character LCD.
I kept the cost low, the final machine cost is about $149.
I kept soldering to a minimum. The only soldering is wire connectors for the toggle switches.
The desktop version will require basic soldering of the LED lights to ground.

I watched Dan Eater's videos on
[how to Build an 8-bit computer from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLLlz7OhtlfKYk8nkyF1u-cDwzE_S0vcJs&index=14)
And so, where other emulator designs used a printed PCB board, I used breadboards.

Most clones, replicas, use an Arduino Due.
I started with an Arduino Nano, but due to increasing memory requirements, I moved to the Mega 2560 (ATmega2560).

I have completed a development machine, it's refined, tuned, and tested.
The components are mounted on a clipboard which makes it a steampunk tablet.
The desktop model design will be based on the tablet machine.
The major difference between the machines, is that the tablet model has 8 address toggles where the desktop model will have 16 address toggles.
