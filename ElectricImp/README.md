# Electric Imp Notes

Development environment: [ImpCentral](https://impcentral.electricimp.com).

### Development Plan

Next:
````
Update Twilio colleagues on my progress, and include the sensor data link.
Send an SMS from my Imp device.
Low battery use. Example, have my Imp outside to get outside sensor values.
Use NodeMCU to retrieve the sensor data.
Use I2C to communications with Arduino devices.
````

Done:
````
Initialize device and online environment.
Program and run Hello world.
Read and echo onboard sensor data.
Send sensor data to the Agent.
Basic webserver processing of a request and making a response.
Basic webserver processing of a GET request when the parameter names are known.
Post sensor data on a webserver.
Setup and use development environment such as: STREAMING_ACCESS_KEY.
````
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Program Samples

#### Hello World

Hello World server log message program that goes in the Device Code section:
````
server.log("Hello from your imp development device");
````

#### Web server functions.

[WebAgent.nut](WebAgent.nut)

#### Reading A Sensor

Program to read and echo the sensor data: temperature, humidity, and air pressure.

Program listing:
[SensorReadingDevice.nut](SensorReadingDevice.nut) and
[SensorReadingAgent.nut](SensorReadingAgent.nut)

Links I used when developing the program:

[Reading a sensor](https://developer.electricimp.com/examples/introduction-applications/reading-sensor),
[Electric Imp imp001 Explorer Kit](https://developer.electricimp.com/hardware/resources/reference-designs/explorerkit)(my hardware),
and
Air pressure Library: [LPS22HB](https://developer.electricimp.com/libraries/hardware/lps22hb).

Sample output:
````

### Sending a Twilio HTTP Request

[Docs for "http"](https://developer.electricimp.com/api/http)

[Docs for "http post"](https://developer.electricimp.com/api/http/post)

The headers can be any supported by "http", for instance:
````
{ "Content-Type" : "text/xml" }
````

Sample code.
The added header is for basic authentication where the username and password are base64 encoded.
You'll need to replace "AC123...89" and "twilio_account_authtoken", with your own Twilio account SID and auth token.
````
function SendSms(TextMessage) {
   local twilio_account_sid = "AC123...89";
   local url = "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/"+twilio_account_sid+"/Messages.json";
   local Body = "From=" + twilioNumber + "&To=" + toNumber + "&Body=" + TextMessage;
   local userpassword = "Basic " + http.base64decode(twilio_account_sid + ":" + "twilio_account_authtoken");
   local request = http.post(url, {"Authorization" : userpassword}, Body);
   request.sendasync(processSmsResponse);
}
````
